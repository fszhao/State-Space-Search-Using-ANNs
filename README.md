# State Space Search Using Artificial Neural Networks

## Overview:
 
State space search is a problem-solving method commonly employed in artificial intelligence, where the problem-solving process is modeled as a search through a space of possible states. These states represent different configurations or situations, and the goal is to find a sequence of actions that lead from an initial state to a goal state. State space search algorithms explore this space systematically to identify a solution path, and they are often employed in tasks such as pathfinding, puzzle solving, and optimization problems.


Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) can be integrated into state space search problems to supplment and/or enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the search process. 


This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates the usage of an the A* Search algorithm for navigating search spaces as well as the use of Artificial Neural Networks by agents in identifying/determining obstacles within that search space.
